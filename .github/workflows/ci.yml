# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [macos-latest, ubuntu-latest]
      fail-fast: false # Don't kill all jobs in matrix if one fails

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Get the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Building LLVM
        run: sh scripts/install_llvm.sh
